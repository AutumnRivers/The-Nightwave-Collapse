If you don't remember the ballot you cast
It's printed on every receipt you were passed
Each time you selected our products and services
We were elected in each of your purchases
What's left to do when you've got the monopoly?
Turn the consumer into the commodity

- Gregory J. Holgate, "The Data Stream"
