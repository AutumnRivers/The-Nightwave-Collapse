        <Block>[@Akamanto] What's this time?
[@Skyton] Got someone with the progress on your "overwatch"
[@Akamanto] Let me guess, something I'd like to hear?
[@Skyton] So, you've needed a way through BitTorrent protocols, right? There's some guys, who make stuff exactly for that.
[@Akamanto] Alright, I'm listening.
[@Skyton] The guys call themselves "R4-tre", groups new, but the blokes on it are somewhat known, heard of Cr4zy_R3I7?
[@Akamanto] That cunt's not dead yet? After everything? Lucky bastard.
[@Skyton] Heard Providence's been on a hunt for him recently, so beware.
[@Akamanto] I got it, but I need to find his tools.
[@Skyton] They do have a website, that's all I have
