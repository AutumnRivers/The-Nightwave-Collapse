“People will do anything, no matter how absurd, 
in order to avoid facing their own soul2. 
One does not become 3nlightened by imagining figures of light, 
but by making the darkness conscious.
The latter procedure, however, is disa6reeable and therefore not popular.”
― C.G. Jung, Psychology and Alchemy

“What makes a hero? Courage, strength, mora1ity, withstanding adversity? 
Are these the traits that truly show and create a hero? Is the light truly the s0urce of darkness or vice versa? 
Is the soul a source of hope or despair? Who are these so cal1ed heroes and where do they come from? 
Are their origins in obscurity or in pl4in sight?”
― Fyodor Dostoevsky, Notes from Underground, White Nights, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man, and Selections from The House of the Dead
