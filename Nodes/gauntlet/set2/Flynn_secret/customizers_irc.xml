        <post user="Ivka">You know, looking at your theme, I just can't work with it.</post>
        <post user="Ange">Huh?!</post>
        <post user="Ange">Is it broken? What's wrong?</post>
        <post user="Ivka">No-no. I just... I keep staring back at him</post>
        <post user="Ange">...</post>
        <post user="Ange">Wait, who... What?</post>
        <post user="Ivka">Y'know... Flynn</post>
        <post user="Ange">Oh come on. Isn't it inspiring?</post>
        <post user="Ange">As if he's there, watching over your actions, supporting you, like calming, isn't it?</post>
        <post user="Ivka">Being stared down is not my thing, really</post>
        <post user="TheWrenchFries">Must agree with Ivka here. That smug furry face gives me the creeps.</post>
        <post user="TheWrenchFries">With the fucked up netMap placement this thing might be a nominee for the worst theme of the channel.</post>
        <post user="Ange">@TheWrenchFries, it's not a furry! It's a sahash!</post>
        <post user="Adamkriaco">its a goat</post>
        <post user="TheWrenchFries">I could pretend I care about a classification of anthropomorphous animals but the truth is I don't give a fuck.</post>
        <post user="TheWrenchFries">This excuse of yours only reinforces my thoughts of you being a furry nerd.</post>
        <post user="TheWrenchFries">And the thing is your comment doesn't belittle the overall wretchedness of the theme, so it still sucks.</post>
        <post user="N0klinsiq">@Ivka, not like ya runnin' a facken macrosoft bliss</post>
        <post user="Ivka">It's actually unnerving...</post>
        <post user="N0klinsiq">@Ange where I can get ye' thing? Wanna take a peek at it, since Ivka got all scared</post>
        <post user="Ange">I'll get it up to the cloud when I get home</post>
        <post user="N0klinsiq">We have a cloud for this?</post>
        <post user="Ange">Yep, a whole subdomain, the ".cloud" one</post>
